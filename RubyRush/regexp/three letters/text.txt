The 4680 cells are twice as large as Tesla's existing units, but they have five times the capacity.
That lets Tesla either extend the range of its vehicles or use fewer batteries to maintain the same range, potentially shrinking costs.
In the new Model Y version, they're implemented in a structural battery pack that should reduce complexity and weight, further improving efficiency.
